# new-leaf

**Description:**
This project revolves around the theme "turning over a new leaf", which was the focal point of SFU FALL HACKS 2023. In this context, we've created an engaging card game that combines symbol matching and autumn-related trivia to deliver an enjoyable user experience. The implemenation of this game relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The objecive of the game is to be the first to answer six questions correctly. Each time a question is answered corretctly, the corresponding leaf that was on the card changes colour on the board, signifying progress. The game proceeds to the next player after each question.
